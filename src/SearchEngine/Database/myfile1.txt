Being far away from you is the most awful and hardest thing I have endured to this moment. 
Every day without you is when I spend heartbroken. 
I know we are destined together and being apart brings me great pain, 
and I will not be normal until I see your beautiful face for I feel a piece is missing in my body. 
Until I hear your sweet voice of silk once again, I will keep on missing you more than I have ever missed any person in my life.
